# danfactory

> A template for starting Claude Code projects. It gives you a guided start (brainstorm → decision tree → operating model), saves tokens by design, keeps the docs indexed, tracks delivery metrics, runs security audits on request, and deploys to Cloudflare via git.

## Start a new project

1. On GitHub: **Use this template → Create a new repository** (turn on *Settings → Template repository* for danfactory once). Or copy it by hand:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dalhhorn-ship-it/danfactory my-project && cd my-project && rm -rf .git && git init
   ```
2. Bootstrap. Add `--codegraph` to install the local code graph:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/bootstrap.sh "my-project" "one line description"   # flags: --codegraph, --cloudflare (auto-created Worker)
   ```
3. Start Claude Code (`claude`) and say **"let's start"**. The SessionStart hook tells Claude which phase you're in.

## Adopt an existing build (e.g. migrate a Lovable app)

Install danfactory once as a Claude Code plugin. Then, inside the other repo, run the `adopt` skill:

```bash
/plugin install danfactory --marketplace dalhhorn-ship-it/danfactory
```

```bash
/danfactory:adopt
```

It works on a `danfactory/adopt` branch and never overwrites your files:
1. Scans what was built (origin, stack, tests, CI, hosting, security and quality findings) into `docs/ADOPTION-REPORT.md`.
2. Uses the decision tree (Q0 → adopt-existing → the path to continue on) to choose the operating model.
3. Installs hooks, agents, skills, scripts, the docs index and CI, and merges settings, `CLAUDE.md` and `.gitignore`.
4. Drafts GOAL.md from the as-built state, seeds BACKLOG.md and TECH-DEBT.md, builds the dashboard, and writes `docs/NEXT-BUILDS.md`.

Lovable specifics (two-way sync, Supabase RLS, moving hosting to Cloudflare) are in docs/operating-model/paths/adopt-existing.md. Without plugins, run `bash scripts/install-adopt-skill.sh` from a danfactory clone; it installs `/danfactory-adopt` for your user.

## The flow

| Phase | Skill | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Agree the goal | `brainstorm` (talks it through with you) | docs/GOAL.md |
| 2. Choose how to work | `choose-path` (decision tree, rigor L0–L3) | docs/OPERATING-MODEL.md, factory.json, ADR |
| 3. Build | path playbook + subagents | code / workbook / document … |
| Milestones | `retro`, `metrics` | LEARNINGS.md, tree updates, metrics/REPORT.md |
| Every build | `dashboard` (automatic) | dashboard/index.html: versions, progress, backlog, tech debt, key metrics, plus a Roadmap tab (value vs technical-foundation swimlanes) and a Deploy tab (links, success rate, push-to-live stats, deploy history) |
| On request | `security-audit-run`, `ship` | audit report, live deploy |

### Agents (docs/operating-model/AGENT-ROUTING.md)

The 18 agents are routed by moment and rigor, not all run every time. A verification ladder decides how many checkers a task gets (none at L0, up to five at L3).

| Role | Agents |
|---|---|
| Plan & design | product-manager, software-architect (Opus), spreadsheet-architect |
| Build | developer, code-writer, data-builder |
| Cheap helpers (Haiku) | bulk-reader, test-runner, doc-keeper, deploy-watcher, claude-md-compliance-checker |
| Verify | reviewer, task-completion-validator, code-quality-pragmatist, karen, jenny, ui-comprehensive-tester |
| Debug | ultrathink-debugger (Opus, only after a failed first attempt) |

The verifiers and debugger are adapted from [darcyegb/ClaudeCodeAgents](https://github.com/darcyegb/ClaudeCodeAgents) (MIT).

### Paths (docs/operating-model/paths/)

The paths are deliberately different, so a spreadsheet isn't run like a SaaS app.

| Path | Use for | Heavy lifting |
|---|---|---|
| software-product | apps, APIs, services | vertical slices, TDD, CI, git → Cloudflare |
| library-cli | packages, SDKs, CLIs | API-first, semver, examples as tests |
| data-spreadsheet | workbooks, models, CSV/reports | `data-builder` generator scripts + xlsx skill |
| documents-content | docs, decks, handbooks | outline-first, docx/pptx/pdf skills |
| research-analysis | research, comparisons, analysis | deep-research fan-out, sources ledger |
| automation-script | glue, jobs, bots | idempotent, dry-run, cron on Cloudflare |
| infra-ops | IaC, pipelines, DNS | plan/apply split, least privilege |
| prototype-spike | throwaway learning | time-box, kill/promote date |

## What's inside

| Piece | Where | Idea taken from |
|---|---|---|
| Large-read guard + delegation subagents | .claude/hooks/guard_large_read.py, .claude/agents/ | [spotify shunt](https://github.com/spotify/portal-ai-plugins/tree/main/plugins/shunt), re-targeted from AiKA to native Haiku/Sonnet subagents |
| Docs quick-reference + doc knowledge graph | docs/INDEX.md, docs/knowledge-graph.json, scripts/docs_index.py | generated from headings and links; auto-refreshed by a hook |
| Code knowledge graph | `bash scripts/install-codegraph.sh` | [codegraph](https://github.com/colbymchenry/codegraph) (local, telemetry off) |
| Metrics: test time, coverage, deploys, tokens | scripts/metrics.py, metrics/ | budgets in factory.json; token use recorded at SessionEnd |
| Build dashboard | scripts/dashboard.py, docs/BACKLOG.md, docs/TECH-DEBT.md | regenerated by every metrics run and CI build; CI uploads it as an artifact |
| Security audit (on request) | `security-audit-run` skill | [cloudflare/security-audit-skill](https://github.com/cloudflare/security-audit-skill), installed on demand |
| Short contexts + handoff notes | handoff skill, .claude/hooks/context_watch.py, pre_compact.py, CLAUDE.md compact instructions | NVIDIA "You don't need long context": note at logical boundaries, `/clear`, note reloads automatically |
| No waiting on git/CI/Cloudflare | deploy-watcher subagent, scripts/wait-for-url.sh, .githooks/pre-push, docs/policies/async-delivery.md | push-and-continue, bounded waits, test once, skip docs-only builds |
| Deploy via git to Cloudflare | `ship` skill, templates/deploy-cloudflare.yml | [cloudflare-deploy skill](https://github.com/davila7/claude-code-templates/blob/main/cli-tool/components/skills/development/cloudflare-deploy/SKILL.md), installed on demand |

On-demand skills are listed in `factory.json → integrations.skills`. Install one with `bash scripts/install-skill.sh <name>`. They are git-ignored, so the template stays small and every install pulls the current version.

## Commands

```bash
bash scripts/check.sh                  # template self-checks (CI runs this)
python3 scripts/docs_index.py          # regenerate docs index + knowledge graph
python3 scripts/metrics.py test        # run tests, record time + coverage
python3 scripts/metrics.py report      # metrics/REPORT.md with alerts + suggestions
python3 scripts/dashboard.py --open    # build + open the project dashboard
bash scripts/install-skill.sh security-audit
bash scripts/install-skill.sh cloudflare-deploy
```

Requirements: git and python3 (stdlib only). Node/npm are needed for codegraph and wrangler only when you use them.

## Feeding learnings back into the template

`retro` tags learnings that apply to every project with `[upstream]`. From the project, run `python3 scripts/upstream_learnings.py --template ../danfactory`: it appends unsent entries to the template's LEARNINGS.md, marks them `[upstreamed]`, and lists which shared docs (tree, routing, paths) differ, for you to port. Then open a PR in the template and bump the tree version. New projects then start from the improved tree.
